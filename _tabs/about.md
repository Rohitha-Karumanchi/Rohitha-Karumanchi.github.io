Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet🌍, where I talk about all things tech, security🔐, and the cool stuff I learn along the way.

I work in Product Security🛡️, so expect a lot of cybersecurity talk— think secure coding, vulnerability management 🚨, security tooling 🛠️, and whatever else catches my attention. But it doesn’t stop there! I also explore new technologies, document my hands-on projects📝, and share insights from my day-to-day work✍️.

🔥What You’ll Find Here:🔥

🔹 Security deep dives – because its fun!

🔹 Tools & techniques – useful ones, not just another “Top 10” list.

🔹 Work experiences & lessons learned – Because it isn’t just about theory; it’s about problem-solving.

🔹 Side projects & experiments – because curiosity keeps things interesting; sometimes failing🤦‍♂️, always learning📚.

This blog is my way of thinking out loud 🗣️, learning 🤓 and hopefully sharing interesting insights💡. If that sounds like your kind of thing, stick around—let’s geek out together! 🚀

✨✨
