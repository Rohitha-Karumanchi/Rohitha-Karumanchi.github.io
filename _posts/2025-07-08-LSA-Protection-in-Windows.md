### LSA Protection in Windows: What It Is, Why It Matters, and Why It’s Too Rarely Enabled

If you work in security or IT and care about **credential protection**, you’ve likely heard of LSA Protection (RunAsPPL). But how often is it actually enabled in your environment/organisation?

**In this blog, we'll look into:**

- What is LSA and what does "RunAsPPL" really mean?
- Why LSA protection is crucial for defending credentials
- How attackers try to bypass it (real CVEs and techniques)
- Why many orgs still leave it disabled (risks & tradeoffs)
- How to check, enable, and audit it across your estate

## What is LSA and What is RunAsPPL?

**LSA (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service)**  
The `lsass.exe` process in Windows is responsible for:

- Authenticating logins
- Validating users
- Storing/managing decrypted credentials (e.g., password hashes, Kerberos tickets)
- Applying local security policies and auditing settings

This makes LSASS a prime target for attackers following initial compromise.

**RunAsPPL ("Run as Protected Process Light")**  
Introduced in Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2012 R2, **RunAsPPL** makes `lsass.exe` a “protected process.”  
It means only other protected processes or kernel-level code can access LSASS memory—blocking Mimikatz and similar user-mode tools, even if run with admin rights.

**Enabling RunAsPPL reduces the risk of credential dumping via common attack tools.**

> **Note:** Kernel-mode malware or vulnerable/signed drivers can still bypass LSA Protection.

## Why LSA Protection Matters

- **Credential theft** from LSASS is a key move for advanced attackers.
  - **Mimikatz** and its clones extract passwords, hashes, or Kerberos tickets.
  - Enables **lateral movement**: attackers “Pass-the-Hash” or “Pass-the-Ticket” to move deeper into the network.
- With **LSA Protection**, attackers can no longer dump credentials using user-mode tools—they’ll need to find a kernel exploit or weak/legacy driver instead.

> It’s not a cure-all, but dramatically limits credential theft through LSASS memory.

## Real Attacks and CVEs Involving LSASS

**Relevant CVEs/examples:**
- `CVE-2022-26966`: Elevation of privilege via LSA spoofing
- `CVE-2022-37987`, `CVE-2022-37989`: Bypass of Credential Guard/LSA defenses
- Credential dumping seen in many ransomware/APT campaigns (Conti, FIN6, TrickBot, etc.), using:
    - Tools: `procdump`, `taskmgr`, `mimikatz`, direct LSASS injection

## ❓ Why Many Orgs Don’t Enable RunAsPPL

| Reason                         | Description                                                                                |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compatibility Issues        | Older drivers or third-party security products may fail, crash, or lose functionality      |
| Tool Limitations            | Password recovery or forensics tools may stop working                                      |
| Deployment Risk             | Sudden change can disrupt critical workflows or lock out users/services                    |
| Lack of Awareness           | Admins may not know this control exists or what it blocks                                  |

> Even Microsoft does **not** enable RunAsPPL by default on upgrades—only on clean installs of newer Windows releases.

## How to Check If LSA Protection is Enabled

**To check on a local machine:**
```
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name "RunAsPPL"
```
- **Value `1`**: Enabled
- **Value `0` or missing**: Disabled

---

## How to Enable RunAsPPL Safely

**Update the registry (reboot required):**
```
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa]
"RunAsPPL"=dword:00000001
```

### **Best Practices Before Deployment:**
- **Pilot:** Test on a non-critical subset of systems.
- **Check Compatibility:** Verify all endpoint security, management, and forensics tools function correctly.
- **Combine with:** [Windows Defender Credential Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard) for stronger protection.

## Audit LSA Protection Across Your Domain

**PowerShell Audit Script:**
```
$computers = Get-ADComputer -Filter * | Select -ExpandProperty Name
foreach ($computer in $computers) {
try {
$value = Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computer -ScriptBlock {
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name "RunAsPPL" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}
if ($value.RunAsPPL -ne 1) {
Write-Output "$computer does NOT have LSA protection enabled."
}
} catch {
Write-Output "Could not connect to $computer"
}
}
```

*Tip: For large-scale and repeatable settings, use Group Policy, Intune, or SCCM to enforce configuration.*

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Startup failures after enabling RunAsPPL:** Some security agents or management tools may be incompatible—consult vendor documentation and update drivers.
- **Memory dump tool failures:** This is expected. Use **kernel-debugging** tools or protected auditing software for incident response.
- **Unexpected application issues:** Revert the registry value, reboot, and contact your CTI/security engineering team for compatibility review.

## Final Thoughts

- **LSA Protection isn’t a silver bullet**, but it is a critical baseline for Windows hardening.
- **If an attacker gets admin,** LSA Protection may be the barrier that blocks lateral movement via credential theft.
- **Always pair with:**
    - Credential Guard
    - Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules
    - Event log monitoring (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 10 for LSASS access attempts)
- **Recommended workflow:** Awareness → Testing → Gradual Deployment → Wide-scale enforcement
