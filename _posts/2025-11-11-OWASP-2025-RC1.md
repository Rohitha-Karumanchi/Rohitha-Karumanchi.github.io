The **OWASP Top 10 2025** (Release Candidate 1, published November 6 2025) is now out, and there are some changes worth your attention.  
Let’s break down what’s new, what changed, and what it means for developers, testers, and security professionals — in plain language and real examples.

## What Makes OWASP 2025?

- This year’s list looks beyond code-level bugs and digs into how software is *built and connected* — from cloud configurations to third-party dependencies.
- OWASP analyzed roughly **175,000 mapped vulnerabilities** (using CVE-to-CWE data) plus community input to identify which weaknesses most frequently lead to real-world incidents.
The result?  
- A clearer picture of the security problems modern development pipelines face.

## Two New Risk Categories

### 1. Software Supply Chain Failures (A03)
- Even if your code is perfect, a **compromised dependency, tool, or build step** can still infect your system. That’s how supply chain failures work in software.
- This category expands on 2021’s “Vulnerable and Outdated Components,” covering everything from third-party libraries to CI/CD tools and package repositories.

**Real-world examples:**
- The **SolarWinds** compromise (2020), where attackers infiltrated build systems.
- The **event-stream** npm package hack (2018), which slipped malicious code into a widely used dependency.
- The **Codecov** CI pipeline breach (2021).
- The **XZ Utils** backdoor attempt (2024–2025), where a trusted compression utility was nearly weaponized before discovery.

**Why it matters:**  
- Software ecosystems now depend on thousands of external components.  
**Supply-chain-based incidents have increased over 300% since 2021, according to OWASP’s analysis.**

**What to do:**
- Generate and review a **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** for every build.
- Verify dependency integrity (hashes, signatures).
- Secure CI/CD pipelines and restrict who can modify build scripts.

### 2. Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions (A10)

- Think of an ATM glitching mid-transaction. If it reveals your balance or ejects extra cash, that’s a system failing under pressure.
- “Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions” captures the **24 CWEs** tied to insecure error handling — everything from unsafe exception logging to “fail-open” logic.
- Too often, when apps crash or face unusual inputs, they behave unpredictably: exposing stack traces, skipping authorisation, or leaking secrets.

**What to do:**  
- Test not just the *happy path* but also the *failure path.*  
- Ask, “What happens when things go wrong?”  
- Ensure the system fails *securely* — no skipped checks, no data exposure, and no revealing debug messages.

## One Major Consolidation: SSRF Now Under Broken Access Control (A01)

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), which appeared as its own category (A10) in 2021, is now merged with **Broken Access Control (A01).**

## What Changed in the Rankings?

OWASP’s new dataset reorders priorities based on prevalence and impact. Here’s what stands out:

| Rank | Category | Key Trends & Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **A01** | **Broken Access Control** | Still #1 — affects about **3.73% of tested applications.** Attackers exploit authorisation flaws to access data they shouldn’t. Example: a hospital system flaw lets one user view another patient’s record. |
| **A02** | **Security Misconfiguration** | Up from #5 to #2. Roughly **3% of analysed applications** failed basic configuration hygiene — exposed ports, default credentials, or cloud missteps. |
| **A03** | **Software Supply Chain Failures** | Newly added and already top 3. Reflects rising dependency and pipeline compromises like SolarWinds and XZ Utils. |
| **A04** | **Cryptographic Failures** | Down slightly. Encryption practices are improving, but legacy algorithms and key-management gaps remain common. |
| **A05** | **Injection** | Includes **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).** Frameworks reduce risk but don’t eliminate it — attackers still find unvalidated inputs and serialisation flaws. |
| **A06–A08** | **Insecure Design, Authentication Failures, Software/Data Integrity Failures** | Remain core risks tied to design flaws and weak identity or trust assumptions. |
| **A09** | **Logging & Alerting Failures** | Re-focused for 2025: it’s now about *real-time, actionable alerts* — not just storing logs for later review. Detection speed is security. |
| **A10** | **Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions** | Brand-new category covering 24 CWEs in error-handling logic. |

## Why It Matters
The 2025 list reflects a shift from isolated code issues to **system-level weaknesses.**  
- Modern security now spans code, infrastructure, and every third-party connection in between.

If you build or secure software, focus on these priorities:
1. **Audit your dependencies and pipelines.** Every package and plugin is part of your attack surface.  
2. **Automate and validate configurations.** Use infrastructure-as-code scanners and enforce least privilege in cloud roles.  
3. **Test your failure behaviour.** Break things intentionally to confirm they fail securely.  
4. **Modernise cryptography.** Phase out weak ciphers, rotate keys, and enforce TLS best practices.  
5. **Monitor actively.** Logging without alerting is like a smoke detector that doesn’t beep.

Bring these lessons into your next code review, DevOps sprint, or design meeting.

## Final Thoughts
The **OWASP Top 10 2025 (RC1)** captures the evolution of software risk:  
- From access control to supply chain, from design to error handling, it’s all connected.
*Our systems are only as strong as their weakest dependency — or their least tested failure mode*
- Whether you write code, manage pipelines, or defend infrastructure, this update is your signal to review, refactor, and reinforce.  
- And once the **final OWASP Top 10 2025** is published later this year, revisit your checklist to see what’s changed.
