title: From Finding Bugs To Managing Exposure - What It Means For Product Security

  Every Monday morning would start with a fresh batch of security scan results, and we would dive into the endless cycle of patch-and-repeat. Sound familiar? Then let's dive in🏊‍♂️

## The Old Way
For years, we’ve been focused on patching vulnerabilities as soon as they pop up. 🔍Scan, find, fix, repeat🌀. Sounds great in theory, but in reality? It’s a never-ending chase. 

💭Imagine this: You lock your house, double-check the doors, and even install a fancy alarm system. You feel safe, right? 
But what if there’s an open window at the back that you never noticed? Or maybe you left a spare key under the mat—because, well, convenience. That’s kind of what traditional vulnerability management feels like.

Security teams are drowning in CVEs, most of which don’t even pose a real-world threat📢. Meanwhile, attackers aren’t waiting for us to catch up. They’re looking for the easiest way in—just like a thief checking for that open window.

# Enter Exposure Management
Exposure management is like switching from a microscope to a satellite view. It’s like stepping back and looking at the whole picture instead of just focusing on individual cracks. 

Instead of asking, “Do we have vulnerabilities?”, we now ask, “What can actually be exploited in our environment?” and other broader questions:
* How exposed is this vulnerability to potential attackers?
* What's the actual business impact if this gets exploited?
* Which of our assets are most critical?
* What's our attack surface looking like?
  
## What it brings in for ProductSecurity?
Exposure management shifts the focus. Instead of blindly fixing vulnerabilities, you look at:
* Accessibility: Is the flaw behind authentication and network segmentation?
* Exploitability: Is there an active exploit, or is it just a theoretical risk?
* Business Impact: A low-risk issue in a critical system may be more dangerous than a high-risk one in an unused feature.
* Context Over CVSS: Not all critical vulnerabilities need urgent fixes— That vulnerability in your internal tool might not need immediate attention.

## Making the Shift: Practical Steps📝
* Map Your Attack Surface
* * Start simple. List out your public-facing assets. What can attackers see? What could they potentially reach?
* Understand Business Context
* * Talk to your business teams. Understand which systems are critical for daily operations. A vulnerability in your core payment system needs different treatment than one in your internal wiki.
* Think Like an Attacker
* * Don't just rely on scanners. Ask yourself: "If I were trying to breach my own system, what would I target first?"

#### Let's be honest – is it just a buzzword? So is exposure management just vulnerability management with a fancy new name?
I don't think so, and here's why: It's not about doing something completely different; it's about doing something more comprehensive. 

Think of it like upgrading from checking your door locks (vulnerability management) to having a complete home security system with cameras, motion sensors, and neighborhood watch (exposure management).

#### Is exposure management perfect? No. Does it add complexity? Yes. 
But in a world where attacks are getting more sophisticated🧩 and our systems more interconnected, we need to think bigger than just vulnerabilities.

Remember💡: Security isn't about being perfect; it's about being better prepared. And sometimes, that means changing how we look at the problem.

### The move from vulnerability management to exposure management isn’t about ignoring vulnerabilities; it’s about being smarter in handling them. It’s like prioritizing putting out a house fire before fixing a leaky faucet. Both need attention, but one is clearly more urgent.
