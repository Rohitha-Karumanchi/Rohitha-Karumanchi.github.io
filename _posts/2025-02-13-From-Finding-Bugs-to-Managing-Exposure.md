title: From Finding Bugs To Managing Exposure - What It Means For Product Security
description: >-
  Every Monday morning would start with a fresh batch of security scan results, and we would dive into the endless cycle of patch-and-repeat. Sound familiar? Then let's dive in🏊‍♂️

## The Old Way
For years, we’ve been focused on patching vulnerabilities as soon as they pop up. 🔍Scan, find, fix, repeat🌀. Sounds great in theory, but in reality? It’s a never-ending chase. 

💭Imagine this: You lock your house, double-check the doors, and even install a fancy alarm system. You feel safe, right? 
But what if there’s an open window at the back that you never noticed? Or maybe you left a spare key under the mat—because, well, convenience. That’s kind of what traditional vulnerability management feels like.

Security teams are drowning in CVEs, most of which don’t even pose a real-world threat📢. Meanwhile, attackers aren’t waiting for us to catch up. They’re looking for the easiest way in—just like a thief checking for that open window.

## What needs to be noticed?
💭One more scenario but this one, on the Tech side: You're running a small e-commerce site. Your security scanner flags 100 vulnerabilities. You patch them all, pat yourself on the back, and call it a day. Job done, right?

Well, not quite. Here's why:

That SQL injection vulnerability in your admin panel? It's technically "high severity," but since the panel is only accessible from your internal network, the real-world risk might be lower than you think. 
Meanwhile, that "medium severity" misconfiguration in your public API might be getting actively exploited.

# Enter Exposure Management
Exposure management is like switching from a microscope to a satellite view. It’s like stepping back and looking at the whole picture instead of just focusing on individual cracks. 

Instead of asking, “Do we have vulnerabilities?”, we now ask, “What can actually be exploited in our environment?” and other broader questions:
* How exposed is this vulnerability to potential attackers?
* What's the actual business impact if this gets exploited?
* Which of our assets are most critical?
* What's our attack surface looking like?
  
## What it brings in for ProductSecurity?
Exposure management shifts the focus. Instead of blindly fixing vulnerabilities, you look at:
✅ What’s actually accessible to attackers? (Is this flaw behind authentication?)
✅ Is there a known exploit? (Just because there’s a CVE doesn’t mean it’s actively being used.)
✅ What’s the real business impact? (A low-severity bug on a critical system might be more dangerous than a high-severity issue in a rarely used feature.)

Got it, let's articulate it with some technical phrases:

#### Context is King
Instead of just looking at CVSS scores, we're now considering the full context. That vulnerability in your internal admin tool might not need immediate attention if it's behind three layers of authentication and network segmentation.
#### Business Impact Drives Priority
Remember that "low severity" configuration issue? If it's in your payment processing system, it might need attention before that "critical" vulnerability in your rarely-used testing environment.
#### Prevention Over Reaction
We're shifting from "find and fix" to "prevent and protect." This means thinking about security architecture, access controls, and network segmentation from day one.

### Just one more example and then we reach the end:
Again 💭: A scanner flags a high-severity vulnerability in an open-source library your product uses. Panic mode? Not necessarily. 
Exposure management helps you pause and ask:
* Is this specific scenario that results in vulnerability even exist in our product? (Coz most of the times, usage of a library doesn't lead to exploit but some specific issues like a port or some dependency)
* Is it externally accessible? (If it's not then.. may be you can reduce a number in severity score?)
* Are there any real-world exploits?
If the answer to these is no, then maybe it’s not your top priority.
Instead, you might shift your focus to something actively being targeted, like an exposed admin panel with weak authentication. See the difference?

## Making the Shift: Practical Steps
No, we're not going to reach the end without seeing practical steps📝.
* Map Your Attack Surface
Start simple. List out your public-facing assets. What can attackers see? What could they potentially reach?
* Understand Business Context
Talk to your business teams. Understand which systems are critical for daily operations. A vulnerability in your core payment system needs different treatment than one in your internal wiki.
* Think Like an Attacker
Don't just rely on scanners. Ask yourself: "If I were trying to breach my own system, what would I target first?"

#### Let's be honest – is it just a buzzword. So is exposure management just vulnerability management with a fancy new name?
I don't think so, and here's why: It's not about doing something completely different; it's about doing something more comprehensive. 

Think of it like upgrading from checking your door locks (vulnerability management) to having a complete home security system with cameras, motion sensors, and neighborhood watch (exposure management).

#### Is exposure management perfect? No. Does it add complexity? Yes. 
But in a world where attacks are getting more sophisticated🧩 and our systems more interconnected, we need to think bigger than just vulnerabilities.

Remember💡: Security isn't about being perfect; it's about being better prepared. And sometimes, that means changing how we look at the problem.

### The move from vulnerability management to exposure management isn’t about ignoring vulnerabilities; it’s about being smarter in handling them. It’s like prioritizing putting out a house fire before fixing a leaky faucet. Both need attention, but one is clearly more urgent.
